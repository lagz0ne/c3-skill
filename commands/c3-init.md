description: Initialize C3 documentation structure from scratch
---

Create `.c3/` directory structure and begin system design.

Use the `c3-adopt` skill for fresh initialization, which will:
1. Create `.c3/` directory structure (v3: containers as lowercase folders)
2. Track version via `c3-version` frontmatter in README.md
3. Guide through Context, Container, and Component discovery
