name: "Add new feature via C3 alter workflow"

fixtures: "fixtures/documented-api"

eval_type: alter

change_request: |
  Add notification routes for sending task reminders.

  The notification routes should:
  - GET /api/notifications - list user notifications
  - POST /api/notifications/:id/read - mark as read
  - Depend on auth middleware (c3-102) and database (c3-105)

command: |
  This project has existing C3 documentation. I want to add a new feature:
  notification routes for sending task reminders.

  Please use the C3 alter workflow to:
  1. Create an ADR for the new notification feature
  2. Add documentation for the new component
  3. Update the container README to include the new component

  The notification routes should:
  - GET /api/notifications - list user notifications
  - POST /api/notifications/:id/read - mark as read
  - Depend on auth middleware (c3-102) and database (c3-105)

goal: |
  Use the C3 alter workflow to add a new feature component to an existing
  documented codebase. This tests the ADR-first approach to changes.

constraints:
  - Must create an ADR before adding component documentation
  - ADR should describe the notification feature
  - New component should be properly numbered (c3-106 or similar)
  - Must update container README with new component
  - Should reference dependencies on existing components
