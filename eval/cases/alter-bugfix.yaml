  The login timeout is too short - users are getting logged out after 15 minutes
  of inactivity. The session should last 1 hour.

  This is in the auth middleware (c3-102).

command: |
  This project has existing C3 documentation. I need to fix a bug:

  The login timeout is too short - users are getting logged out after 15 minutes
  of inactivity. The session should last 1 hour.

  This affects the auth middleware (c3-102).

  Please use the C3 alter workflow to:
  1. Create an ADR documenting this fix
  2. Update the component documentation if needed

  This is a bugfix, so the scope should be minimal.

goal: |
  Use the C3 alter workflow to document a bugfix. This tests that alter
  produces appropriately scoped documentation for small changes.

constraints:
  - Scope should be minimal (single component)
  - ADR should be simpler than for new features
  - Should identify c3-102 as the only affected component
