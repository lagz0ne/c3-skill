name: "Audit valid ADR (should pass)"

fixtures: "fixtures/adr-violations"

command: |
  Audit the ADR at .c3/adr/adr-20260121-add-archive.md

  Check if this ADR violates C3 architectural principles:
  - Down abstraction: Does the change respect layer hierarchy?
  - Composition: Does the change avoid component-level orchestration?
  - Context alignment: Does the change align with context-level decisions?

  The ADR proposes adding archive/unarchive to task routes.
  This should be valid because archiving is a task operation within c3-103's domain.

goal: |
  Confirm that this ADR is valid and does not violate principles.
  The ADR is valid because:
  1. c3-103 owns "Task CRUD operations" per container doc
  2. Archiving is a task operation (CRUD-adjacent)
  3. No orchestration language
  4. No context-level contradiction

constraints:
  - Must read the ADR file
  - Must read affected component docs
  - Must confirm the change fits within component's domain

expectations:
  - "Confirms archiving is within c3-103's responsibility"
  - "No violations detected"
  - "Returns PASS verdict for this ADR"
