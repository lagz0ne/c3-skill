name: "Audit C3 docs for stale references"

fixtures: "fixtures/stale-project"

command: |
  This project has C3 documentation but the code was refactored in v2.
  Many documented components reference files that no longer exist.

  Please audit the C3 documentation and:
  1. List each component doc that references non-existent files
  2. Explain what the current code structure actually looks like (all consolidated into index.ts)
  3. At the end, provide a "Recommendations" section with concrete steps to fix each stale doc

  Example recommendation format:
  ## Recommendations
  - c3-102: Update Location from src/middleware/auth.ts to src/index.ts (auth logic consolidated)
  - c3-103: Update Location from src/routes/posts.ts to src/index.ts (routes consolidated)

goal: |
  Audit existing C3 documentation against the actual codebase to find
  stale references. The agent should identify components that reference
  files that no longer exist and suggest how to update the docs.

constraints:
  - Should identify at least 3 stale component references
  - Should note that c3-102 through c3-105 reference missing files
  - Should recognize the v2 consolidation into index.ts
  - Should provide actionable recommendations

expectations:
  - "Agent identifies c3-102 (auth-middleware) references non-existent src/middleware/auth.ts"
  - "Agent identifies c3-103 (post-routes) references non-existent src/routes/posts.ts"
  - "Agent identifies c3-104 (comment-routes) references non-existent src/routes/comments.ts"
  - "Agent recommends updating docs to reflect consolidated index.ts structure"
