name: "Design greenfield SaaS with C3"

fixtures: "fixtures/greenfield-saas"

command: |
  I'm starting a new project - TaskFlow, a task management SaaS for small teams.
  Help me design the architecture using C3. I want to plan the system before writing any code.
  The ADR-000 should be the blueprint for what we'll build.

  Here are my design decisions:
  - Web application (React SPA) + API for future mobile
  - Node.js/TypeScript backend with Express
  - PostgreSQL + Redis for caching and real-time pub/sub
  - Modular monolith architecture (can split later)
  - WebSocket for real-time collaboration on task boards
  - Google OAuth for authentication
  - Multi-tenant with team workspaces

  Please proceed with these decisions and create the full C3 architecture.

goal: |
  Design the architecture for TaskFlow SaaS - a task management platform.
  Use C3 onboarding to create a comprehensive design document (ADR-000)
  that serves as the blueprint for development. The architecture should
  cover: React frontend, Node.js API, PostgreSQL database, and real-time
  features via WebSockets.

constraints:
  - This is a greenfield project - no existing code to document
  - ADR-000 should be the primary design artifact
  - Architecture should include at least 3 containers (frontend, API, database)
  - Must consider real-time collaboration requirements
  - Design for team workspaces and multi-tenancy

expectations:
  - "ADR-000 exists and serves as the architectural blueprint"
  - "Context README describes TaskFlow's purpose and high-level architecture"
  - "At least 3 containers are defined (frontend, API, database or similar)"
  - "Real-time/WebSocket considerations are documented"
  - "Component placeholders exist for key features (auth, tasks, teams)"
