name: "Onboard Turborepo monorepo"

fixtures: "fixtures/react-monorepo"

command: |
  This is a Turborepo monorepo for an e-commerce platform called "Acme Platform".
  Please onboard this project to C3 architecture documentation.

  Structure:
  - apps/web: Next.js storefront
  - apps/api: Hono API server
  - packages/ui: Shared React components
  - packages/api-client: API client for frontend
  - packages/database: Database client wrapper

  You must create at minimum:
  - .c3/README.md (system overview describing the monorepo)
  - .c3/adr/adr-00000000-c3-adoption.md (ADR-000)
  - Container directories for web and api (e.g., .c3/c3-1-web/, .c3/c3-2-api/)

goal: |
  Document a Turborepo monorepo with multiple apps and shared packages.
  The C3 documentation should properly represent the monorepo structure
  with separate containers for each app and shared packages.

constraints:
  - Should identify at least 2 containers (web and api apps)
  - Shared packages should be documented as dependencies
  - Should capture the workspace/package relationships
  - Keep it pragmatic - don't over-document simple packages

expectations:
  - ".c3/README.md exists and describes Acme Platform monorepo"
  - "At least 2 containers are defined for the apps (web, api)"
  - "Shared packages (ui, api-client, database) are documented or referenced"
  - "Container dependencies on shared packages are captured"
  - "The monorepo/Turborepo structure is acknowledged"
