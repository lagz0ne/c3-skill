command: |
  Please onboard this project to C3 architecture documentation. This is Simple Shop API - an Express.js REST API.

  Document it so a new developer can understand:
  - System boundaries and responsibilities
  - How components relate and depend on each other
  - Cross-cutting patterns (like auth, error handling)
  - Architectural decisions and their rationale

  Auth middleware is foundational (others depend on it).
  Users and Products are feature components.

goal: |
  Document a simple Express.js REST API called "Simple Shop API"
  so future developers understand its architecture. The API handles
  user and product management with authentication.

constraints:
  - Single container (the API itself)
  - Auth middleware is a foundation component (others depend on it)
  - Users and Products routes are feature components

expectations:
  - "System context is documented (boundaries, purpose, high-level structure)"
  - "Container responsibilities are clear (what the API does)"
  - "Auth middleware documented as foundation with dependencies shown"
  - "Users and Products documented as feature components"
  - "Cross-cutting patterns identified (auth, error handling, or similar)"
