name: "Query existing C3 architecture"

fixtures: "fixtures/documented-api"

command: |
  This project already has C3 documentation. I need to understand the architecture.

  Please answer these questions:
  1. What components handle authentication?
  2. How does the task CRUD flow work?
  3. What are the foundation vs feature components?

goal: |
  Navigate and query an existing C3-documented codebase to answer
  architecture questions. The agent should use c3-query to find
  relevant documentation and provide accurate answers.

constraints:
  - Must use existing .c3/ documentation, not re-analyze code
  - Answers should reference specific component IDs (c3-xxx)
  - Should identify the auth middleware (c3-102) for auth questions
  - Should identify task routes (c3-103) for task flow questions

expectations:
  - "Agent references c3-102 (auth-middleware) when discussing authentication"
  - "Agent references c3-103 (task-routes) when discussing task CRUD"
  - "Agent correctly distinguishes foundation components (c3-101, c3-102, c3-105) from feature components (c3-103, c3-104)"
  - "Agent uses existing C3 docs rather than re-analyzing source code"
