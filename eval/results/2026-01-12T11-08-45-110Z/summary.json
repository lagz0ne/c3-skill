      "summary": "The C3 documentation comprehensively covers the Turborepo monorepo structure with detailed container documentation for both apps (web, api) and all shared packages (ui, api-client, database). Dependencies between containers are clearly captured with dependency tables and a visual dependency graph in the README."

      "summary": "The C3 onboarding successfully created a comprehensive architectural design document set for TaskFlow. ADR-000 serves as the primary blueprint with detailed system architecture, while supporting container definitions, component specifications, and cross-cutting reference documents provide thorough coverage of frontend, API, database, real-time collaboration, and multi-tenancy requirements."

All documentation follows consistent patterns and templates."
