The agent created a comprehensive C3 architecture documentation suite with ADR-000 serving as the blueprint, context diagram describing TaskFlow's purpose, multiple containers clearly defined (frontend, API, PostgreSQL, Redis), extensive real-time/WebSocket documentation, and component placeholders for all key features including auth, tasks, teams, and more."

It properly referenced the correct component IDs for authentication (c3-102) and task CRUD (c3-103), correctly identified the foundation vs feature component distinction, and exclusively used the pre-existing .c3/ documentation rather than analyzing source code."
