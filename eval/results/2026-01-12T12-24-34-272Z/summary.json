      "summary": "The documentation comprehensively covers the Turborepo monorepo structure with detailed container and component documentation. However, it fails expectation 1 because no .c3/README.md file was created - the c3-index.md and c3-context.md serve similar purposes but don't satisfy the specific README.md requirement."
