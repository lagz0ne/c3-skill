      "score": 100,
      "duration": 97575,
      "summary": "The output excellently documents the Turborepo monorepo with comprehensive C3 architecture documentation. It properly defines 2 containers (web and api), documents all shared packages, captures container-package dependencies with a visual diagram, and explicitly acknowledges the Turborepo structure throughout."

      "duration": 460287,
      "summary": "All expectations are fully met. The C3 onboarding created a comprehensive architectural blueprint with ADR-000 as the primary design artifact, detailed context documentation, 5 container definitions, extensive real-time/WebSocket documentation, and well-defined component placeholders for all key features."

      "summary": "All expectations are fully met. The output demonstrates complete C3 documentation structure with a system README, container directory (c3-1-api), properly classified foundation component (Auth Middleware) and feature components (Users, Products), plus the required ADR-000 adoption decision record."

      "summary": "The agent successfully queried existing C3 documentation to answer architecture questions. It correctly identified and referenced authentication (c3-102), task routes (c3-103), and properly distinguished foundation from feature components, all using the pre-existing .c3/ documentation rather than re-analyzing source code."

      "summary": "The agent successfully identified all stale component references (c3-102 through c3-105), correctly noted they reference missing files removed during v2 refactoring, and recognized that functionality was consolidated into index.ts. The output provides clear actionable information for documentation updates."

      "summary": "The agent successfully followed the ADR-first workflow by creating an ADR before implementation, then creating the component documentation for c3-106-notification-routes with proper dependencies on c3-102 and c3-105, and updating the container README. All artifacts follow consistent patterns and structure."
