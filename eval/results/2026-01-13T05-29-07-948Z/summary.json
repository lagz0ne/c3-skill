      "summary": "The output fully satisfies all expectations. The C3 documentation comprehensively captures the Turborepo monorepo structure with well-defined containers for web and api apps, properly documents all three shared packages (ui, api-client, database), clearly shows container dependencies, and acknowledges the Turborepo build system throughout."

      "summary": "All expectations are fully met. The output includes a comprehensive ADR-000 architectural blueprint, context documentation describing TaskFlow's purpose, 4 defined containers (frontend, API, database, Redis), extensive WebSocket/real-time documentation, and detailed component documentation for auth, tasks, and teams modules."

      "summary": "The documentation comprehensively covers all architectural aspects. The README provides clear system context with diagrams, container responsibilities are documented, Auth is properly identified as a foundation component with no dependencies, Users and Products are documented as feature components depending on auth, and cross-cutting patterns are explicitly listed including auth, REST patterns, and error handling."
