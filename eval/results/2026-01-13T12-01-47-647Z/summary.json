      "summary": "The C3 documentation comprehensively captures the Turborepo monorepo structure with proper container definitions for both apps, well-documented shared package dependencies, and clear acknowledgment of the monorepo architecture. The documentation follows a pragmatic approach without over-documenting simple packages."

      "summary": "All expectations are fully met. The C3 architecture documentation is comprehensive with ADR-000 as the blueprint, proper context documentation, 4 containers defined (exceeding the 3 minimum), extensive real-time/WebSocket documentation, and detailed component placeholders for auth, tasks, teams, and notifications."

It properly referenced c3-102 for authentication, c3-103 for task CRUD, correctly identified the foundation vs feature component distinction, and relied exclusively on existing .c3/ documentation rather than re-analyzing source code."
