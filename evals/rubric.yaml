name: C3 Documentation Quality
description: |
  Evaluates the quality of C3 architecture documentation.
  Focus: Does this documentation enable ADAPT/ALTER decisions?

criteria:
  - name: Completeness
    weight: 3
    description: |
      Does the documentation capture all significant architectural elements?
      - All major containers identified
      - Component inventories reflect actual code structure
      - Relationships/interactions documented
    scoring: |
      0-3: Major containers or components missing
      4-6: Most elements captured, some gaps
      7-8: Complete coverage with minor omissions
      9-10: Comprehensive, nothing significant missing

  - name: Accuracy
    weight: 3
    description: |
      Does the documentation match the actual codebase?
      - Container boundaries align with code structure
      - Technology stack matches reality
      - Relationships reflect actual dependencies
    scoring: |
      0-3: Significant misalignment with code
      4-6: Generally accurate with some errors
      7-8: Accurate with minor discrepancies
      9-10: Precisely matches codebase

  - name: Clarity
    weight: 2
    description: |
      Is the documentation clear and understandable?
      - Concise, not verbose
      - Diagrams aid understanding
      - Terminology consistent
    scoring: |
      0-3: Confusing or overly verbose
      4-6: Understandable but could be clearer
      7-8: Clear with good structure
      9-10: Exceptionally clear and well-organized

  - name: Actionability
    weight: 2
    description: |
      Does this enable ADAPT/ALTER decisions?
      - Reader could add a new feature knowing where it fits
      - Reader could fix a bug knowing affected components
      - Entry points and hand-offs are clear
    scoring: |
      0-3: Would need to read code anyway
      4-6: Provides some guidance but incomplete
      7-8: Good guidance for most changes
      9-10: Clear path for any modification

  - name: Convention Compliance
    weight: 1
    description: |
      Does it follow C3 conventions?
      - Correct ID patterns (c3-0, c3-N, c3-NNN)
      - Proper frontmatter
      - Mermaid diagrams (not ASCII)
      - No premature component docs (inventory-first)
    scoring: |
      0-3: Multiple convention violations
      4-6: Some violations
      7-8: Mostly compliant
      9-10: Fully compliant

  - name: Diagram Quality
    weight: 1
    description: |
      Are diagrams useful and accurate?
      - Show relevant relationships
      - Not too cluttered
      - Mermaid syntax correct
      - Add value beyond text
    scoring: |
      0-3: Missing, broken, or misleading diagrams
      4-6: Basic diagrams present
      7-8: Good diagrams that aid understanding
      9-10: Excellent diagrams, clear and informative
