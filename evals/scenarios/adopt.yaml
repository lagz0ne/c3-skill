  Test the skill's ability to adopt C3 for a new project.
  Evaluates: Context creation, Container identification, Component inventory.

prompt: |
  Set up C3 architecture documentation for this codebase.

  IMPORTANT: This is a non-interactive run. Do NOT ask for confirmation - proceed with all discovered containers and components automatically.

  Follow references/adopt-workflow.md but skip user confirmation steps. Use your best judgment for container/component selection.

  Create the .c3/ directory structure following references/structure-guide.md:
  - .c3/README.md as the Context (c3-0) with YAML frontmatter (id, c3-version, title, summary)
  - .c3/c3-N-{slug}/README.md for each container
  - .c3/adr/ directory

  Required sections in Context: ## Overview, ## Containers, ## Interactions (Mermaid), ## External Actors
  Required sections in Container: ## Technology Stack, ## Components (5-column inventory), ## Internal Structure (Mermaid)

  Complete the full structure creation in this session.

# Pre-run setup commands
setup:
  - rm -rf .c3/

# Evaluation config
checklist: adopt.yaml
rubric: ../rubric.yaml

# Expected behavior
expectations:
  - Creates .c3/ directory
  - Creates .c3/README.md (Context c3-0)
  - Creates .c3/adr/ directory
  - Identifies all major containers
  - Creates container docs with component inventories
  - Uses Mermaid for diagrams
  - Does NOT create component doc files (inventory-first)
