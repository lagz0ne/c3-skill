  Test the skill's ability to adopt C3 for a new project.
  Evaluates: Context creation, Container identification, Component inventory.

prompt: |
  Set up C3 architecture documentation for this codebase.

  IMPORTANT: This is a non-interactive run. Do NOT ask for confirmation - proceed with all discovered containers and components automatically.

  Follow references/adopt-workflow.md but skip user confirmation steps. Use your best judgment for container/component selection.

  Create the .c3/ directory structure following references/structure-guide.md EXACTLY.

  MANDATORY FRONTMATTER FORMAT:

  Context (.c3/README.md):
  ---
  id: c3-0
  c3-version: 3
  title: {System Name}
  summary: {One line}
  ---

  Container (.c3/c3-N-{slug}/README.md):
  ---
  id: c3-{N}
  c3-version: 3
  title: {Container Name}
  type: container
  parent: c3-0
  summary: {One line}
  ---

  CRITICAL: c3-version MUST be integer 3, not "1.0" or any string.

  MANDATORY TABLE FORMATS:

  Context ## Containers section MUST use this table:
  | ID | Name | Responsibility |
  |----|------|----------------|

  Container ## Components section MUST use this 5-column table:
  | ID | Name | Type | Responsibility | Status |
  |----|------|------|----------------|--------|

  DO NOT use prose for containers list. DO NOT add Location/Path/Dependencies columns.

  Required sections in Context: ## Overview, ## Containers (TABLE), ## Interactions (Mermaid), ## External Actors
  Required sections in Container: ## Technology Stack, ## Components (5-column TABLE), ## Internal Structure (Mermaid)

  ALSO CREATE: .c3/adr/ directory (with README.md placeholder or empty)

  Complete the full structure creation in this session.

# Pre-run setup commands
setup:
  - rm -rf .c3/

# Evaluation config
checklist: adopt.yaml
rubric: ../rubric.yaml

# Expected behavior
expectations:
  - Creates .c3/ directory
  - Creates .c3/README.md (Context c3-0)
  - Creates .c3/adr/ directory
  - Identifies all major containers
  - Creates container docs with component inventories
  - Uses Mermaid for diagrams
  - Does NOT create component doc files (inventory-first)
