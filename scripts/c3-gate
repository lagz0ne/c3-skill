# C3 Architecture Gate (Simplified)
#
# Gates Edit/Write operations in C3-adopted projects.
# Requires an accepted ADR to exist before any code changes.
#
# Behavior:
# - If no .c3/README.md: Allow (not a C3 project)
# - If file is in .c3/: Allow (documentation)
# - If any ADR with status: accepted exists: Allow
# - Otherwise: Block with guidance
#
# Exit codes:
# - 0: Allow the operation
# - 2: Block the operation (stderr shown to user)

[c3-gate] Change blocked: ${REL_PATH}

No accepted ADR found in this C3 project.

To modify code in a C3 project:
1. Use c3-orchestrator agent to analyze the change
2. Create ADR with approved-files list
3. Set ADR status to 'accepted'
4. Then Edit/Write will be allowed

Run: "I want to change ${REL_PATH}" to start analysis.
