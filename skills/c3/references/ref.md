# Ref Reference

Manage patterns as first-class architecture artifacts.

Hard rule: can't name a concrete file → create ref, not component.

## Mode Selection

| Intent | Mode |
|--------|------|
| "add/create/document a pattern" | **Add** |
| "update/modify ref-X" | **Update** |
| "list patterns", "what refs exist" | **List** |
| "who uses ref-X" | **Usage** |
| "remove/deprecate ref-X" | **change** (needs ADR) |

---

## Add

Flow: `Scaffold → Discover → Fill Content → Discover Usage → Update Citings → ADR`

**HARD RULE: First Bash call must be scaffold.**

### Step 1: Scaffold

```bash
bash <skill-dir>/bin/c3x.sh add ref <slug>
```

### Step 2: Discover (2-5 Grep calls)

Search for existing implementations of the pattern in the codebase.

| Findings | Mode | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| 0 files | **Describe** | User describes pattern (original behavior) |
| 1 file | **Extract** (low confidence) | Extract, flag to user for confirmation |
| 2+ files | **Extract** (compare top 3) | Structural intersection = pattern |
| User provides | **Accept** | Use user's description directly |

### Step 2c: Extract Pattern

From discovered code:
- **Shared structure** → `## How` (golden pattern)
- **Varies by context** → `## Choice` (decision point)
- **Clearly wrong** → `## Not This` (anti-pattern)

Annotate examples: `// REQUIRED` vs `// OPTIONAL` for structural elements.

### Step 2d: Confirm

`AskUserQuestion` — present extracted pattern for approval (ASSUMPTION_MODE: skip).

### Step 2e: Quality Gate

Write 1-3 YES/NO compliance questions derivable from `## How`. If you can't write them, the pattern is too vague — rework before proceeding.

### Step 3: Fill Content

From discovery + user input:
- `## Goal` — what it standardizes
- `## Choice` — option chosen (REQUIRED)
- `## Why` — rationale (REQUIRED)
- `## How` — golden pattern (format-flexible: code blocks, do/don't pairs, checklists)
- `## Not This` — rejected alternatives + anti-examples
- `## Scope`, `## Override` — as needed

### Step 4: Discover Usage (2-3 Grep calls)

Find components using this pattern.

### Step 5: Update Citing Components

For each component using pattern:
1. Run `c3x lookup <file>` per code-map entry — loads constraint chain
2. Read component doc
3. Add to `## Related Refs`:

```markdown
## Related Refs

| Ref | How It Serves Goal |
|-----|-------------------|
| ref-error-handling | Uses error response format |
```

Only modify `## Related Refs`. Other changes → route to change.

### Step 6: Adoption ADR

```yaml
---
id: adr-YYYYMMDD-ref-{slug}-adoption
title: Adopt {Pattern Title} as standard
status: implemented
---
```

Ref adoption ADRs use `status: implemented` directly — ref doc IS the deliverable.

---

## Update

Flow: `Clarify → Find Citings → Check Compliance → Surface Impact → Execute`

1. **Clarify:** `AskUserQuestion` — add rule / modify rule / remove rule / clarify docs (ASSUMPTION_MODE: skip)
2. **Find citings:** `c3x list --json` → ref entity → `relationships`. Grep `ref-{slug}` in `.c3/` for depth.
3. **Check compliance:** `c3x lookup <file>` per code-map entry. Categorize: compliant / needs-update / breaking.
4. **Surface impact:** `AskUserQuestion` — proceed / narrow / cancel (ASSUMPTION_MODE: skip)
5. **Execute:** Update ref doc + create ADR. Non-compliant → note as TODO in ADR (don't touch code).
6. Code changes → route to change.

---

## List

```bash
bash <skill-dir>/bin/c3x.sh list --json
```

Filter `type: "ref"`. Show: id, title, goal, citing components.

```
**C3 Patterns**

| Ref | Title | Goal |
|-----|-------|------|
| ref-error-handling | Error Handling | Consistent errors |
```

---

## Usage

```bash
bash <skill-dir>/bin/c3x.sh list --json
```

Find `id: "ref-{slug}"`, read `relationships`. Read each citing doc.

```

## Separation Test: Ref vs Rule

Before creating a ref, ask: **"Remove the Why section. Does the doc become useless?"**

| Answer | Type | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| Yes — useless without Why | **Ref** | Create ref (this flow) |
| No — still tells you what to do | **Rule** | Route to `references/rule.md` Add flow |
| Both — has rationale AND enforcement | **Dual** | Create ref for rationale + rule for enforcement (see `references/rule.md` Migrate flow) |

If the pattern is primarily about enforcement (golden examples, coding standards), it belongs as a rule, not a ref.

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Correct |
|--------------|---------|
| Create ref without user input | Extract specifics from prompt |
| Update ref without impact check | Always check citings |
| Duplicate ref content in components | Cite, don't duplicate |
| Create ref for one-off pattern | Refs for repeated patterns only |
| Create ref for enforceable coding standard | Use rule instead (Separation Test) |
