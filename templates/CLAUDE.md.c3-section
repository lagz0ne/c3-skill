# Architecture

## C3 Architecture

**Before architectural work:** Spawn `c3-skill:c3` subagent first.

It reads .c3/ docs, analyzes impact, and creates ADRs when needed.

### Triggers: Spawn c3 Agent

| You're about to... | First... |
|--------------------|----------|
| Add a new feature | Spawn c3 agent |
| Change an API | Spawn c3 agent |
| Refactor code | Spawn c3 agent |
| "Just quickly fix something" | Spawn c3 agent (2 min saves 20 min) |

### Red Flags: STOP and Spawn c3 Agent

🚩 "I'm not sure where this code should go"
🚩 "This might affect other services"
🚩 Creating new directories without checking boundaries

### ⚠️ ADR Policy

**DO NOT read ADRs** unless asked - they're historical context, not current guidance.
