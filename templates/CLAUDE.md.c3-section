# Architecture

## 🧠 Before You Code: Check the Architecture

This project has **documented architecture** in `.c3/`. Reading it first makes you significantly more effective.

```bash
ls .c3/README.md 2>/dev/null && echo "📚 Architecture docs exist - READ FIRST"
```

### Why This Matters

| Without .c3/ docs | With .c3/ docs |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Guess where code belongs | Know exactly which container owns it |
| Hope API contracts are correct | See documented protocols |
| Discover patterns by accident | Understand patterns upfront |
| Risk breaking undocumented flows | See flows before touching them |

### Your Architecture Superpower

**Before any significant change, ask yourself:**

> "Do I understand where this fits in the architecture?"

If NO → Read `.c3/` docs first. They exist to save you from mistakes.

If `.c3/` doesn't exist → Suggest using `/c3` to create it.

### Quick Navigation

| Question | Answer Location |
|----------|-----------------|
| What is this system? | `.c3/README.md` |
| What containers exist? | `.c3/README.md` → Containers table |
| How do they communicate? | `.c3/README.md` → Interactions |
| What's inside container X? | `.c3/c3-{N}-*/README.md` |
| How does component Y work? | `.c3/c3-{N}-*/c3-{N}{NN}-*.md` |

### Triggers: When to Think About Architecture

| You're about to... | First... |
|--------------------|----------|
| Add a new file/module | Check which container it belongs to |
| Change an API | Read the documented protocol |
| Refactor code | Verify against documented flows |
| Add inter-service communication | Check container interactions |
| "Just quickly fix something" | Read the component doc (2 min saves 20 min) |

### Red Flags: Stop and Read .c3/

🚩 "I'm not sure where this code should go"
🚩 "I'll figure out the architecture as I implement"
🚩 "This might affect other services"
🚩 Creating new directories without checking boundaries
🚩 Changing function signatures on shared code

### Commands & Skills

| Need to... | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Explore or design architecture | `/c3` or `c3-design` skill |
| Bootstrap docs for new project | `c3-adopt` skill |
| Understand a specific layer | `c3-context-design`, `c3-container-design`, `c3-component-design` |

### ⚠️ ADR Policy

**DO NOT read ADRs** (Architecture Decision Records) unless asked:
- They're historical context, not current guidance
- Reading them pollutes your context with old debates
- Current architecture is in Context/Container/Component docs
