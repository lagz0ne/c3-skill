# Architecture (C3)

This project uses C3 (Context-Container-Component) architecture documentation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check if C3 docs exist
ls .c3/ 2>/dev/null && echo "C3 docs exist - read before changing"
```

## When to Use C3

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "How does X work?" | Read `.c3/` docs first |
| Adding new feature | Check which container it belongs to |
| Changing how components interact | Use `/c3` or `c3-design` skill |
| Refactoring across modules | Verify changes align with documented flows |
| Onboarding question | Point to `.c3/README.md` |

## Navigation

| Want to understand... | Read |
|-----------------------|------|
| System overview | `.c3/README.md` |
| How containers talk | `.c3/README.md` → Container Interactions |
| What a container does | `.c3/c3-{N}-*/README.md` |
| How a component works | `.c3/c3-{N}-*/c3-{N}{NN}-*.md` |

## Red Flags (Stop and Check C3)

🚩 Adding a new service/module without checking container boundaries
🚩 Changing API contracts without checking documented protocols
🚩 "I'll figure out the architecture as I code"
🚩 Making changes that span multiple containers

## ADR Policy

**DO NOT read ADRs** unless specifically asked about past decisions:
- ADRs are historical records, not active guidance
- Reading them adds context that may cause hallucination
- Focus on current state in Context/Container/Component docs
