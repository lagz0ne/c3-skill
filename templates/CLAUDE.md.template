# C3 Architecture Enforcement Template

## Architecture Documentation (Add to CLAUDE.md)

This project uses **C3 (Context-Container-Component)** architecture methodology.

### Mandatory Behavior

**For ANY architecture-related question:**

1. **DO NOT** read `.c3/` files directly
2. **ALWAYS** invoke the `c3-design` skill first
3. Let the skill guide exploration or design workflow

### Why This Matters

The `c3-design` skill provides:
- **Exploration mode**: Guided navigation with context awareness
- **Design mode**: Structured workflow with mandatory ADR creation
- **Layer awareness**: Appropriate documentation at Context/Container/Component levels

Reading files directly bypasses these benefits and may lead to:
- Missing the big picture (jumping to components without understanding context)
- Inconsistent documentation updates
- Skipped ADR creation for architectural decisions

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/c3` | Design or explore architecture (main entry point) |
| `/c3-config` | Configure C3 settings |
| `/c3-audit` | Verify docs match code reality |
| `/c3-migrate` | Handle version migrations |

### Quick Start

```
User: "How does the authentication work?"
Claude: *Uses c3-design skill in exploration mode*
        *Loads TOC, presents relevant containers/components*

User: "Add a caching layer"  
Claude: *Uses c3-design skill in design mode*
        *Goes through scoping phases, creates ADR*
```

## Optional: Architecture Questions Trigger

Add this pattern to make architecture questions auto-trigger the skill:

```markdown
### Architecture Question Patterns

When user asks any of these question types, use `c3-design` skill:
- "What's the architecture?"
- "How does X work?"
- "Why did we choose X?"
- "Show me the X container/component"
- "Explain the system"
- "Walk me through..."
```

## Minimal Version (Just the essentials)

```markdown
## Architecture

Use `/c3` for all architecture work. Documentation lives in `.c3/`.
```
