# ${COMPONENT_NAME}

<!-- what convention/pattern this establishes -->

## Conventions

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|

## Applies To

<!-- which Foundation/Feature components follow this -->

## References

<!-- symbols first, then patterns, then paths -->

## Testing (if warranted)

<!-- SKIP IF: documentation-only, no enforceable rules, style guide -->

<!--
trivial: skip section
simple: "Lint rule: prefer-type-over-interface"
moderate: how to verify + automation approach
complex: rarely needed - auxiliary is conventions, not logic
-->
