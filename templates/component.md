# ${COMPONENT_NAME}

## Goal

{Why does this component exist? What problem does it solve?}

<!--
WHY DOCUMENT:
- Enforce consistency (current and future work)
- Enforce quality (current and future work)
- Support auditing (verifiable, cross-referenceable)
- Be maintainable (worth the upkeep cost)

ANTI-GOALS:
- Over-documenting → stale quickly, maintenance burden
- Text walls → hard to review, hard to maintain
- Isolated content → can't verify from multiple angles

PRINCIPLES:
- Diagrams over text. Always.
- Fewer meaningful sections > many shallow sections
- Add sections that elaborate the Goal - remove those that don't
- Cross-content integrity: same fact from different angles aids auditing

GUARDRAILS:
- Must have: Goal section
- Prefer: 2-4 focused sections
- Each section must serve the Goal - if not, delete
- If a section grows large, consider: diagram? split? ref-*?

REF HYGIENE (component level = component-specific concerns):
- Before writing: does a ref-* already cover this? Cite, don't duplicate.
- Each ref-* cited must directly serve the Goal - no tangential refs.
- If you're duplicating a ref, cite it instead.

Common sections (create whatever serves your Goal):
- Contract (Provides/Expects), Dependencies, Behavior, Edge Cases, Constraints

<!-- Code symbols, patterns, paths. Each ref-* cited should serve the Goal. -->
