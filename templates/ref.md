## Goal

{What problem does this reference solve? Be specific.}

<!--
WHY DOCUMENT:
- Enforce consistency (current and future work)
- Enforce quality (current and future work)
- Support auditing (verifiable, cross-referenceable)
- Be maintainable (worth the upkeep cost)

ANTI-GOALS:
- Over-documenting → stale quickly, maintenance burden
- Text walls → hard to review, hard to maintain
- Isolated content → can't verify from multiple angles

PRINCIPLES:
- Diagrams over text. Always.
- Fewer meaningful sections > many shallow sections
- Add sections that elaborate the Goal - remove those that don't
- Cross-content integrity: same fact from different angles aids auditing

GUARDRAILS:
- Must have: Goal section
- Prefer: 2-4 focused sections
- Each section must serve the Goal - if not, delete
- If a section grows large, consider: diagram? split?

Common sections (create whatever serves your Goal):
- Rationale, Constraints, Boundaries, Examples

But create whatever sections best elaborate your goal.
